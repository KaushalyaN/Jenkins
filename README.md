# Jenkins

## What I did?
- Created an EC2 instance.
- Installed Java on it because to install Jenkins, Java(JDK) is a pre-requisite.
- Installed Jenkins.
- Added a new inbound rule to open port 8080.
- Logged in to the Jekins using web browser.
- Created First Admin User in Jenkins.
- Installed the Docker Pipeline plugin in Jenkins.
- Docker Slave Configuration was done.
-  Granted Jenkins user and Ubuntu user permission to docker deamon.

Above steps are to preparing Jenkins to create a pipeline as this is my first pipeline.
